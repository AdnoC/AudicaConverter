<b>A .NET Core based tool used for converting maps from other games into .audica files.</b><br>
The biggest innovation from the previous osu! converter is an advanced hand assignment algorithm, in addition to better scaling, streams being converted to chains, long sliders converted to sustains, stacked notes being distributed for readability and proper timing conversion with support for variable bpm.
